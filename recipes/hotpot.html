        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hunt a Huge Scorpion in the dungeon, carefully remove the shell, and extract the meat from the claws and tail. The scorpion meat has a rich, lobster-like flavor.</li>
                <li>Gather Walking Mushrooms from the forest of fungi within the dungeon. Clean them, but keep the caps whole for a meaty bite.</li>
                <li>In a large cauldron, heat slime oil and saut√© dungeon onions and garlic herbs until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the huge scorpion meat and mushrooms, along with water from the crystal springs.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil and add dungeon greens, spicy moss bulbs, and salt from the dungeon rocks.</li>
                <li>Simmer the hotpot until the scorpion meat is tender, and the mushroom caps are soft and bursting with flavor.</li>
                <li>Serve with a side of dungeon root vegetables for a hearty, nutritious meal that boosts energy after battle.</li>
            </ol>
