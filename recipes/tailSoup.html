        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The tail of a Red Dragon is a prized delicacy. It’s tough, but when cooked in a soup, the meat becomes tender and infuses the broth with a rich, smoky flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Red Dragon Tail</li>
                <li>Flame Bat Fat</li>
                <li>Fire Tubers</li>
                <li>Golden Moss Potatoes</li>

                <li>Fire Lizard Spice</li>
                <li>charred Pheonix Feathers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Defeat a Red Dragon in the depths of the dungeon and carefully cut off the tail. The tail meat is dense and rich in flavor.</li>
                <li>In a cauldron, render flame bat fat and sear chunks of Red Dragon Tail until browned.</li>
                <li>Add dungeon root vegetables like fire tubers and golden moss potatoes for added texture.</li>
                <li>Pour in water from the dungeon’s magma-heated springs and simmer the soup slowly.</li>
                <li>Season with dungeon rock salt, fire lizard spice, and charred phoenix feathers to enhance the smoky flavor.</li>
                <li>Simmer for several hours until the meat is tender and the broth is infused with dragon essence.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with chunks of dragon meat and vegetables floating in the rich broth. This dish replenishes stamina and provides resistance to fire-based attacks.</li>
            </ol>
