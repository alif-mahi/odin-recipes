            <h1>Giant Parasite from Giant Kraken: Grilled Plain and Kabayaki-Style</h1>
            <img src="../images/basiliskMeatSkewers.png">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Giant Parasite from the Kraken is a large, squid-like creature with tender, slightly chewy meat. This dish offers two ways of cooking it: one simple grilled, and the other Kabayaki-style, which involves basting the meat with a sweet soy-based sauce.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giant Parasite (from a Giant Kraken)</li>
                    <li>Dungeon Herbs</li>
                    <li>Dungeon Salt</li>
                    <li>Slime Oil</li>
                    <li>Fermented Dungeon Soybeans</li>
                    <li>Dungeon Honey</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Steps for Grilled Plain</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hunt a Giant Kraken and carefully extract the Giant Parasite from its body.</li>
                    <li>Clean and slice the parasite into thick pieces, similar to squid rings.</li>
                    <li>Rub the pieces with dungeon salt and a bit of slime oil for flavor.</li>
                    <li>Grill the parasite over an open flame, turning frequently until charred and tender. This method brings out the natural, subtle flavors of the parasite.</li>
                    <li>Serve plain with a sprinkle of herb salts harvested from the dungeon.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Steps for Kabayaki-Style</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Giant Parasite by slicing it into long, eel-like strips.</li>
                    <li>Create a Kabayaki sauce using dungeon honey, fermented dungeon soybeans (for soy sauce), and dungeon wine.</li>
                    <li>Brush the strips with the Kabayaki sauce and grill them over the fire, basting them with more sauce as they cook.</li>
                    <li>Grill until the parasite has a glossy, caramelized finish. The sweetness of the sauce pairs perfectly with the savory parasite meat.</li>
                    <li>Serve with dungeon greens and a side of steamed dungeon rice for a delicious and well-balanced meal.</li>
                </ol>
